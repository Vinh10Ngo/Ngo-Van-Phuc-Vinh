Scoreboard API Service
Introduction
The Scoreboard API Service module is responsible for managing the scores of users displayed on the website's scoreboard. It provides endpoints for updating user scores and retrieving the top 10 users' scores in real-time.

Flow of Execution

API Endpoints
1. Update User Score
URL: /api/score/update
Method: POST
Request Body:
{
  "userId": "<string>",
  "scoreIncrement": "<number>"
}
Response:
Status Code: 200 OK
Content: { "message": "Score updated successfully" }
Description: This endpoint allows authorized users to update their scores by submitting a POST request with their user ID and the amount by which they want to increase their score.
2. Get Top 10 Users' Scores
URL: /api/score/top10
Method: GET
Response:
Status Code: 200 OK
Content:
{
  "topScores": [
    { "userId": "<string>", "score": "<number>" },
    { "userId": "<string>", "score": "<number>" },
    ...
  ]
}
Description: This endpoint retrieves the top 10 users' scores in descending order. Each entry in the response object contains the user ID and their corresponding score.
Authorization
To prevent malicious users from increasing scores without authorization, the Scoreboard API Service implements authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Authentication: Users must authenticate themselves before accessing the /api/score/update endpoint. This can be achieved using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication.

Authorization: Only authenticated users with the appropriate permissions are allowed to update their scores. Authorization checks should be performed on the server side to ensure that only authorized users can make changes to their scores.

Additional Comments
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests allowed within a certain time period.

Logging: Implement logging mechanisms to track API usage and monitor for any suspicious activities.

Error Handling: Ensure proper error handling mechanisms are in place to handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to clients.

Documentation: Keep the API documentation up-to-date to assist developers in integrating with the Scoreboard API Service.

Testing: Thoroughly test the API endpoints using unit tests and integration tests to ensure reliability and stability.

By following these guidelines, the backend engineering team can effectively implement the Scoreboard API Service module while ensuring security, reliability, and performance.
